## Overview

These are examples of responsible AI that consists of eXplainable AI and fairness of machine learning. 


In order to utilize AI technology to enrich human's life style and contribute to the development of society, we will pursue fairness,  transparency, and accountability while actively engaging in dialogue with stakeholders. We will continue to contribute responsible AI in order to maintain the trustworthy of our products and services.
